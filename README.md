#UserStories

User will load up into a HomePage with a cloudy or zen feel background and maybe music playing. There will be a header with a navigation bar and perhaps a starting quote on the homepage.
There will be a menu bar to the left that holds the authors of each quote. We can also have a prompt box(or something similar) that asks user to sign up. There will be a page for Quote of the day,
Quote by author, and a randomized quote option. We will also have a About page.
