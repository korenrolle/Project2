            <p>Hello! My name is Koren R and along with my project partner Hamim N we build a Rick and Morty website. Rick and Morty is widely know to be a funny, outgoing, cynical, and we are in love with the show. We have been watching Rick and Morty for over 3 yrs now and there is never a dull moment. The amount of characters are vast and the adventures are top notch! When deciding to our project we have a lot of choices but we wanted to pick something that was fun as well as showcased the show for people that probably have never seen it.
“Rick and Morty is the Emmy award-winning half-hour animated hit comedy series on Adult Swim that follows a sociopathic genius scientist who drags his inherently timid grandson on insanely dangerous adventures across the universe. Rick Sanchez is living with his daughter Beth’s family and constantly bringing her, his son-in-law Jerry, granddaughter Summer, and grandson Morty into intergalactic escapades.
Rick and Morty stars Justin Roiland (Adventure Time), Sarah Chalke (Scrubs), Chris Parnell (Saturday Night Live), and Spencer Grammer (Greek). The series is created by Dan Harmon (Community) and Roiland, who also serve as executive producers.
Rick and Morty season 4 premieres this November on Adult Swim.”
